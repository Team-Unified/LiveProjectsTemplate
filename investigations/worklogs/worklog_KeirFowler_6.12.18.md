[Wireframe Prototype](https://github.com/Team-Unified/LiveProjectsTemplate/blob/master/documentation/wireframes/evolus_pencil/Collate%20Your%20Social%20Feed%20App%20Prototype%20v1.epgz)  
Used evolus pencil to create an initial wireframe prototype that allows the user to navigate through our application.  
Awaiting feedback from the rest of the group to ensure no features are forgotten and they are happy to progress using my design.
