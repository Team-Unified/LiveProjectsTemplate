[Authentication Test App](https://github.com/Team-Unified/LiveProjectsTemplate/tree/master/investigations/code/AuthTestApp)

Created a prototype that allows the user to log into the supported social network providers within the app. 

It displays an alert if the login is sucessful and then displays the token within the alert (for debug perposes)

The button to log into Twitter doesn't currently work but i have already started an investigatio [here](https://trello.com/c/Dex0imSO/8-2-why-twitter-doesnt-direct-to-their-login-page), this is a [link](https://trello.com/c/mUIPU1ft/1-5-demo-for-authentication-using-implicit-flow) to the prototype app
