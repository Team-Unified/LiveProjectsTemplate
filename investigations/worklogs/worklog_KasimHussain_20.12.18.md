***Project Update***

[Authentication Test App](https://github.com/Team-Unified/LiveProjectsTemplate/tree/master/investigations/code/AuthTestApp)

[Local Storage Test App](https://github.com/Team-Unified/LiveProjectsTemplate/tree/master/investigations/code/LocalStorageTest)

Both of these projects have been updated with the fixes for LinkedIn and Twitter.

By Removing the WebView plugin i was able to get the networks working as intended.

I have also done basic Plugin Code for Instagram, very barebones but it recives the JSON file and then extracts what we want and need from it, this will help when creating the final application.
