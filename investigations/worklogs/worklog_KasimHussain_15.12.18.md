[Local Storage Test App](https://github.com/Team-Unified/LiveProjectsTemplate/tree/master/investigations/code/AuthTestApp)

Since i already had a working authentication test app i pulled that from the teams repo and made changes to it to allow for caching the users tokens after they successfully authenticate their account.

I will keep these two investigations code seperate, for obvoius reasons when we come to creating the final project, will make it easier to implement part by part.

[Investigation on Trello](https://trello.com/c/fWdrd98s/10-5-get-current-authentication-to-work-with-local-storage-for-saving-tokens-for-retrieval-later)

The app now caches the tokens, if a user is setting up the app for the first time it displays "No Tokens" or if a user has reset all login details it says "Token Reset".

This investigation was completed successfully without any errors or problems along the way
